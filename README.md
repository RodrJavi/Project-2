## Description

This program is a social media app designed to post your weather with your text. It was built to access weather data inside the app, as well as bring back the chronological timeline. We learned how to use handlebars to dynamically form the many pages of the website, the best practice of using dotenv and hiding information inside an env file, and accessing many node modules to utilize thorought the app!
